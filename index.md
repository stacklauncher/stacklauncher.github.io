### Create a quick launch link

Stacklauncher aims to simplify creating AWS launch stack buttons on github by extending the capability of [AWS CloudFormation quick create links](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stacks-quick-create-links.html). Currently this is in early experimental stages and will break frequently!

Enter information below and click the "Create Links" button. You can then either click on the links directly or embed them in Markdown documents or web pages.
